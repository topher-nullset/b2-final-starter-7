Bulk Discounts
A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”. Bulk Discounts are subject to the following criteria:

Bulk discounts should have a percentage discount as well as a quantity threshold
Bulk discounts should belong to a Merchant
A Bulk discount is eligible for all items that the merchant sells. Bulk discounts for one merchant should not affect items sold by another merchant
Merchants can have multiple bulk discounts
If an item meets the quantity threshold for multiple bulk discounts, only the one with the greatest percentage discount should be applied
Bulk discounts should apply on a per-item basis
If the quantity of an item ordered meets or exceeds the quantity threshold, then the percentage discount should apply to that item only. Other items that did not meet the quantity threshold will not be affected.
The quantities of items ordered cannot be added together to meet the quantity thresholds, e.g. a customer cannot order 1 of Item A and 1 of Item B to meet a quantity threshold of 2. They must order 2 or Item A and/or 2 of Item B
Examples
Example 1

Merchant A has one Bulk Discount
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 5
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 5
In this example, no bulk discounts should be applied.

Example 2

Merchant A has one Bulk Discount
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 10
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 5
In this example, Item A should be discounted at 20% off. Item B should not be discounted.

Example 3

Merchant A has two Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Bulk Discount B is 30% off 15 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 12
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 15
In this example, Item A should discounted at 20% off, and Item B should discounted at 30% off.

Example 4

Merchant A has two Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Bulk Discount B is 15% off 15 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 12
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 15
In this example, Both Item A and Item B should discounted at 20% off. Additionally, there is no scenario where Bulk Discount B can ever be applied.

Example 5

Merchant A has two Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Bulk Discount B is 30% off 15 items
Merchant B has no Bulk Discounts
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A1 is ordered in a quantity of 12
Item A2 is ordered in a quantity of 15
Invoice A also includes one of Merchant B’s items
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 15
In this example, Item A1 should discounted at 20% off, and Item A2 should discounted at 30% off. Item B should not be discounted.
